#### Code

-   To use this code open _targets.R and work from there (code is extensively commented in-line). 
-   This project uses the targets package to create its analysis pipeline. The steps are defined in the _targets.R file and the workflow can be executed by running targets::tar_make(). For details on the use of targets see https://books.ropensci.org/targets/.


#### Data
-   All parameters to recreate the 500 parameter sets analyzed for this manuscript are given in the /data folder (see _targets.R for using these to recreate the complete analyzed dataset).


#### Repository Structure and Reproducibility

-   `data/` contains csv files of parameter values
-   `R/` contains functions used in primary _targets R pipeline (main analysis pipeline)
-   `scr_R/` contains R scripts for data exploration and manuscript/supplement figure creation
-   `stan_models/` contains stan model definitions
